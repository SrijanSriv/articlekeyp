# ArticleKeyP

## Overview

ArticleKeyP i.e. Article Key Keypoints is a browser extension that creats a breadcrumb of highlights in an article for ease of grasping the content.

To accurately obtain the article body, it uses the [newpaper](https://github.com/codelucas/newspaper) library.

It uses the TopicRank Extraction Model [(Bougouin et al., 2013)](https://aclanthology.org/I13-1062.pdf) to generate relevant phrases for any article.

## Prospects

The app is expected to generate better results. Some of the changes to be worked upon:

- Use a different method to generate keywords that include longer phrases and sentences
- The extension is limited to [dev.to](https://dev.to) articles. Its use cases has to be increased
